# nosql-challenge

This challenge was completed as an assignment for the UNC Chapel Hill Data Science Bootcamp. In it, I used NoSQL to perform a variety of tasks.

Within this repository there are two main code files and a Resources folder with the JSON to import. To start, you navigate to the Resources folder in your terminal and paste in the import code found in either of the code files. This will use mongoimport to set up the data.

In the NoSQL_setup_starter file, I set up the db and collection and found an example document to allow me to understand the setup of the documents. Then, I created and inserted a new entry into the collection. I then updated the entry to fill in a field I hadn't included for the new entry. I also removed all of the entries that were in Dover and updated some data types.

In the analysis file, I answered 4 questions. To do these, I queried and sorted the collection, counted the documents, and created data frames to hold them. I also created a pipeline to group, match, and sort the answers to the last question.
